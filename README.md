CareConnect - Patient Management System Demo
CareConnect is a feature-rich, interactive demo of a modern patient management system, designed to showcase a complete clinical workflow in a clean, professional interface. This application is built as a single, self-contained HTML file using vanilla JavaScript, making it highly portable and perfect for demonstrating front-end development skills without requiring any backend setup.

The system is organized into several core modules, providing a comprehensive look at the essential functionalities of a real-world healthcare application.

Key Features:
Dashboard: A central hub that gives medical staff an at-a-glance summary of the day's key metrics, including upcoming appointments, total patient count, unread messages, and pending lab results.

Appointment Scheduling: An interactive weekly calendar view to visualize appointments. The module includes a fully functional form to schedule new appointments for any patient in the system, with options for different consultation types (e.g., Annual Check-up, Telemedicine).

Electronic Health Records (EHR): A comprehensive patient records module. It features a real-time searchable patient list. Selecting a patient displays their detailed demographic information, allergies, active conditions, and a complete history of all past encounter notes and prescriptions. New encounter notes can also be added directly to a patient's file.

Prescription Management: A dedicated module for creating and managing patient prescriptions. It includes a form to issue new prescriptions and a table that lists all active prescriptions, with a button to simulate sending them to a pharmacy.

Telemedicine Integration: This module simulates the user interface for virtual health consultations. It lists all scheduled telemedicine appointments and includes a "Start Call" button that launches a modal representing the video call interface.

Security & Compliance: A dedicated section that explains the necessary technical, administrative, and physical safeguards required for true HIPAA compliance in a production environment, demonstrating an understanding of the critical security needs in healthcare software.
